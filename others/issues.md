# Other Questions

### This app is great. Is there a way to donate?

Sorry, this project does not passively accept donations of any kind.

### This app is great. Can I share it with SNS in mainland China?

No, please keep a low profile.

### Does it accept proxy supplier (or any other type of advertisement) promotion?

No, I (keiko233) personally hate advertisements.

### What is the significance of this project?

If you're careful, you'll notice that this project has been around since before many Clash projects were discontinued, and it was initially intended for my (keiko233) own use, but some of the PRs I submitted to Clash Verge were not accepted (merged) for unknown reasons. So I forked a repo and modified it for my own use, and I have nothing to do with what happened after that.
